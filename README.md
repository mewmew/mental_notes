This repository contains my personal knowledge base and brain dump of assorted thoughts.

## Personal knowledge base

As [others before me](http://www.acuriousmix.com/2014/09/03/designing-a-personal-knowledgebase/) I've come to realise that during my life time I'll come across an increasing amount of interesting and high-quality information. Simply relying on my memory alone will not suffice to keep track of these gems of knowledge. The purpose of this knowledge base is to track and summarize fascinating material, so that the core ideas can be referred to and remembered at a later date.

The knowledge base is currently made up of the following categories:

* [Go](go/): inspiring concepts and material related to the Go programming language.
* [Learning](learning/): techniques, tips and resources related to learning, education and knowledge gathering.
