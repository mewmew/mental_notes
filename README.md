# Mental notes

This repository contains my personal knowledge base and brain dump of assorted thoughts.

## Personal knowledge base

Like [others before me](http://www.acuriousmix.com/2014/09/03/designing-a-personal-knowledgebase/) I've come to realise that during my life time I'll come across an increasing amount of interesting and high-quality information. Simply relying on my memory alone will not suffice to keep track of these gems of knowledge. The purpose of this knowledge base is to track and summarize fascinating material, so that the core ideas can be referred to and remembered at a later date.

The knowledge base is currently made up of the following categories:

* [Compilers](compilers/): brilliant articles, slides and papers related to compiler theory.
* [Concurrency](concurrency/): extracts which communicate the *aha* feeling of how to make things concurrent.
* [Go](go/): inspiring concepts and material related to the Go programming language.
* [Learning](learning/): techniques, tips and resources related to learning, education and knowledge gathering.
* [Privacy](privacy/): ideas related to privacy and personal integrity.
* [Reverse Engineering](reverse/): state-of-the-art reverse engineering concepts, tools, techniques, ideas and inspiration.
* [Security](security/): fundamental concepts in computer security (for fun and profit).
* [Simplicity](simplicity/): methods for simplifying life to a minimal core of happiness.

## Projects

[Inspired](http://uppdrag.vaert.se/) by my brother [Henry](https://github.com/karlek) I'll take upon a series of projects meant to challenge my world views, put me out of my comfort zone, help me learn more about myself and make changes to improve my quality of life.

* [Project Cleanup](projects/#project-cleanup): a general cleanup of my life and digital experience.
