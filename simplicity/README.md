    - Digital sabbath (offline for 24 consecutive hours per week, a few week per year, or a few years of your life).
    - Give yourself time to sit still and reflect on what is truly important in your life. Take a step back from the chaotic series of events that make up your life and relate past and future events to the big picture.
