# Concurrency

* [WebAssembly Design - MVP, Code section](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/MVP.md#code-section)
    - Simple but powerful technique for concurrent decoding.

> The code section begins with a table of functions containing the signatures and offsets of each function followed by the list of function bodies. This allows parallel and streaming decoding, validation and compilation.
