1. start with huge interconnectedness of neurons

> "The connections between your eyes and the visual cortex became strengthened as its cells spent years receiving visual inputs and learning to recognize what they mean."

2. pruning

> "In contrast, connections that might have existed between your visual cortex and brain regions that receive taste information from your tongue or touch information from your skin became weaker. After all, most things you see are out of reach and never make it to your mouth, so there isn’t enough of a relationship between the different senses to justify keeping the communication channels between them open."

3. LSD

> "rich and random multisensory experience that is the hallmark of the LSD high — it might be underpinned by the fact that the substance enhances cross talk between regions that have become strangers to each other, perhaps throughout the course of brain development."

## Colour

> "tetrachromacy: four types of cone cells, instead of the regular three; diversity of colours that is about 100 times greater"
>
> Most often, "fourth cone is so similar to the L-cone that the visual system doesn’t even notice its existence."
>
> "the light sensitivity of her fourth cone type was ideally separated from the neighbouring M- and L-cones by a comfortable 12 nanometers"

1. S-cone: purple (shortest wave length, indigo and violet)
2. M-cone: green (medium wave length)
3. L-cone: red (long wave length)
4. 4th code: yellow (in between medium and long)

* [HOW DO OUR COLOUR-BLIND CONES ACHIEVE COLOUR VISION, AND HOW DOES THIS EXPLAIN THE EXISTENCE OF THREE PRIMARIES?](https://theneurosphere.com/2015/12/07/why-are-all-the-colours-we-experience-composed-of-three-primaries/)

metamerism: The reason why computer screens work (i.e. why we perceive RGB pixel as any colour).

> "But here, the cone faces a serious dilemma. What if we first stimulate it with some 455 nm light, to which the cone is most sensitive, and then twice as much 470 nm light, to which the cone is half as sensitive? The cone will produce the exact same signal in both cases. When the brain receives these identical signals, it will have no way of finding out what wavelength of light was responsible for activating this cone, and so will see these two lights as identical! This phenomenon is called metamerism."

Single cones are colour blind and can't be described as seeing colour.

> Why colour vision requires at least two cone types to exist
>
> "Now if the eye encounters lights of the two different wavelengths that trick the first cone into producing an identical signal, the second cone produces different signals for these lights."

Why there are more colours of white, than just white; in particular why white is actually a composition of colours, indistinguishable by us.

> "the three-cone system is equally confused by mixtures of three wavelengths. Thus, for all wavelengths of visible light, there are multiple three-wavelength mixtures that produce the exact same ratio of signals in our three cone types. As a consequence, the brain, which receives information about these signal ratios, is incapable of telling the difference between the various lights which originally prompted the cones to produce their signals."

> I see colors in other colors. .. Other people might just see white light, but I see orange and yellow and pink and green and some magenta and a little bit of blue. So white is not white; white is all varieties of white. You know when you look at a pantone and you see all the whites separated out? It’s like that for me, but they are more intense. I see all those whites in white but I resolve all these colors in the white, so it’s almost like a mosaic. They are all next to each other but connected. As I look at it, I can differentiate different colors.
